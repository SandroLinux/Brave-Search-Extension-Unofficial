# Brave Search Extension (Unofficial)
This is an extension that adds Brave Search to Firefox. This extension is very early in development so expect changes. 
## How can I download this extension?
You can download it from the [Mozilla Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/brave-search-extension/) or you can download the source code from Github 
## Ok what in the world is that logo?
Ok I know it is bad but I am working on an improved version :)
