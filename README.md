# Brave Search Extension (Unofficial)
This is an extension that adds Brave Search to Firefox. This extension is **very** early in development so expect changes. 
## How can I download this extension?
You can download it from the [Mozilla Add-ons Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/brave-search-extension/) or you can download the source code from GitHub and install it using `about:debugging` in firefox. If you don't know how to do that look it up or follow [these instructions](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/12/23/loading-temporary-add-ons/)
## Ok what in the world is that logo?
Ok I know it is bad but I am working on an improved version :)
